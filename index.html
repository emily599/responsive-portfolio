            <p id="absolute"> Hello! My name is Emily Doan and I am a Public Health graduate from the University of
                Washington. Along with my Bachelor of Arts in Public Health, I also have a minor in English. I
                currently reside in Seattle with my two fur babies, King and Mimi.
                <br>
                <br>
                In my free time, I enjoy snowboarding, hiking, watching anime, and playing video games. Currently, I am
                working through Witcher 3, Dark Souls 3, and Zelda:Breath of the Wild. Occasionally, you can find me on
                Overwatch or League of Legends.
                <br>
                <br>
                After building my first computer this past summer, I began having interest in not only the hardware
                side of
                computers, but also the software side. Thus, my journey towards becoming a web developer begins here.
